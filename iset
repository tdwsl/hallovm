[Hallo VM]

16-bit word size
memory is word-addressable
64kword memory, or 128kb
16 registers, mapped to memory 0-15
pc=r15, lr=r14
memory mapped IO
arithmetic, except shift right, is signed
entry point 0x1000
low r0,# -> r0 = r0<<8|#
addi, lit sign extend
nibble immediates are unsigned
jz, jnz are relative
addi pc,# for jump
jl # -> pc = lr<<8|#, lr = old pc

instruction format 1: IA##, IAB#, or IABC

0-3  addi  addir lit   low
4-7  add   sub   and   or
8-b  ldr   str   ldo   sto
c-f  jz    jnz   lt    --

instruction format 2: fIRR, fIR#, or fI##

0-3  shr   shl   xor   mul
4-7  div   rem   andi  ori
8-b  shri  shli  muli  divi
c-f  neg   not   dec   jl

system calls: store call no in memory 0x10

1 - quit
2 - print char in r1
3 - read char to r1
4 - open file for reading, r1=filename -> r0=fd
5 - open file for writing, r1=filename -> r0=fd
6 - write byte, r1=byte, r2=fd -> r0=byte wrote?
7 - write word, r1=word, r2=fd -> r0=word wrote?
8 - read byte, r1=fd -> r0=byte|-1
9 - read word, r1=fd -> r0=word, r1=word read?
